<h2>Building Blocks</h2>
<ul>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
Help (insert name) cross treacherous terrain and obstacles in order to return home.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
What experience do you want players to have when playing your game?
</li>

<li><strong>Genre:</strong>
This is a puzzle game with sandbox elements.
</li>

<li><strong>Game play:</strong>
The player can use the arrow keys to control character movement, and can use the mouse to select and place down building blocks for the character to use to reach his destination. There are a limited number of blocks that the player has to use however.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype goal:</strong>
This game prototype is the first in which I venture into P2 physics in Phaser, as well as the first where I include the mouse as an input.
</li>

<li><strong>Features:</strong>
This game features:
    <ul>
        <li>simple HUD</li>
        <li>mouse control</li>
        <li>different levels/stages</li>
    </ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Setting/Premise:</strong>
A paragraph about the world your game is set in and who the characters are. What makes the game world and its occupants unique and interesting? Do the tokens represent something? If the game has a backstory, put it here. If the game is abstract, then say so.
</li>

<li><strong>Story:</strong>
If the game has a story, summarize it in a paragraph. How will the dramatic tension interact with the gameplay tension?
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
A single sentence that describes the demographic you're trying to reach.
</li>

<li><strong>Play time:</strong>
Let's estimate it at 2 minutes for now.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
First, the player has to determine the overall movement limitations of the character (i.e.: how far he can jump, etc.), and the player must then use this information to help them to construct bridges and the like that are possible for the character to use to navigate across terrain.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
Did you make your prototype assets from scratch? Did you borrow them? Cite your sources here.

    </ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
I can't remember the name of the game, but this prototype is inspired by a game that headlined the news a long time ago where a young teen learned how to create his own iOS app and got several million downloads of it.
