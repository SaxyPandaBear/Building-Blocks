<h2>Building Blocks</h2>
<ul>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
Help Sora cross treacherous terrain and obstacles in order to return home.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
What experience do you want players to have when playing your game?
</li>

<li><strong>Genre:</strong>
This is a puzzle game with sandbox elements.
</li>

<li><strong>Game play:</strong>
There is an exit door for the player, and you must use your blocks to jettison the player into the exit before time runs out. You use the mouse to pick up and drag the blocks, but you have no control over the player without the use of blocks.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype goal:</strong>
This game prototype is the first in which I venture into P2 physics in Phaser, as well as the first where I include the mouse as an input. It's important to note that although I am using P2 physics, I am still just using rectangular shapes for this first demo of it, and don't have "smarter" polygon collision detection yet.
</li>

<li><strong>Features:</strong>
This game features:
    <ul>
        <li>usage of P2 physics</li>
        <li>mouse control</li>
        <li>defined end goal</li>
    </ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Setting/Premise:</strong>
This game takes place in a parallel universe, where you (the player), are watching over a young boy who is lost and needs to find his way back home. You are given the task of using your powers of manipulating blocks to help protect and guide Sora on his journey home.
</li>

<li><strong>Story:</strong>
A young boy named Sora wakes up to find that he is lost and far away from home. An omniscient being with the power of manipulating matter in the form of blocks and shapes watches over Sora and aids him in his journey to find his home and family once more. There is a catch though - the being watching over Sora only has its power during the day, so when night falls, the being cannot watch over Sora.
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
This game is targeted towards families with young children, or just young children, because of the nature of the gameplay being simple, however the back story is rather dark.
</li>

<li><strong>Play time:</strong>
Let's estimate it at 1 minute for now, since that is the timer for our game.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
Using blocks to catapult the player into the exit seems to be the most reasonable strategy with optimal success.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
I can't remember the name of the game, but this prototype is inspired by a game that headlined the news a long time ago where a young teen learned how to create his own iOS app and got several million downloads of it.
