<h2>Building Blocks</h2>
<ul>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
Help Sora cross treacherous terrain and obstacles in order to return home.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
What experience do you want players to have when playing your game?
</li>

<li><strong>Genre:</strong>
This is a puzzle game with sandbox elements.
</li>

<li><strong>Game play:</strong>
The player can use the arrow keys to control character movement, and can use the mouse to select and place down building blocks for the character to use to reach his destination. There are a limited number of blocks that the player has to use however. There is a button for the user to press which toggles the game input on and off, but only for the playable character. The blocks used for the puzzle are still able to be controlled even if the game is "paused".
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype goal:</strong>
This game prototype is the first in which I venture into P2 physics in Phaser, as well as the first where I include the mouse as an input.
</li>

<li><strong>Features:</strong>
This game features:
    <ul>
        <li>usage of P2 physics</li>
        <li>mouse control</li>
        <li>defined end goal</li>
        <li>start/stop feature for player control, but not for physics or block movement</li>
    </ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Setting/Premise:</strong>
A paragraph about the world your game is set in and who the characters are. What makes the game world and its occupants unique and interesting? Do the tokens represent something? If the game has a backstory, put it here. If the game is abstract, then say so.
This game takes place in a parallel universe, where you (the player), are watching over a young boy who is lost and needs to find his way back home. You are given the task of using your powers of manipulating blocks to help protect and guide Sora on his journey home.
</li>

<li><strong>Story:</strong>
A young boy named Sora wakes up to find that he is lost and far away from home. An omniscient being with the power of manipulating matter in the form of blocks and shapes watches over Sora and aids him in his journey to find his home and family once more. There is a catch though - the being watching over Sora only has its power during the day, so when night falls, the being cannot watch over Sora.
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
A single sentence that describes the demographic you're trying to reach.
</li>

<li><strong>Play time:</strong>
Let's estimate it at 1 minute for now.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
First, the player has to determine the overall movement limitations of the character (i.e.: how far he can jump, etc.), and the player must then use this information to help them to construct bridges and the like that are possible for the character to use to navigate across terrain.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
I can't remember the name of the game, but this prototype is inspired by a game that headlined the news a long time ago where a young teen learned how to create his own iOS app and got several million downloads of it.
